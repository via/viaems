- Detect overlapping output schedules on same pin
- New frequency sensors that use DMA (TBD)
+ Improve decoder tests to be less brittle on slight config changes
+ Trigger input DMA to circular buffer
+ Refactor decoder trigger interface now that it is synchronous (also to move
  handling of similtaneous triggers somewhere not platform-specific)
+ Refactor sensor interface now that it is synchronous
+ Dwell time vs BRV
+ Basic tasks
    + Boost control
    + Fan control
    + Idle Control
    + Priming
    + Tip in Enrich

- Determine better ADC strategy, the graphs look awful for every-tooth (for now
  just gather adc async)
- Fix callback handling in interrupts (fix fuel event resched)
