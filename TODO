- Detect overlapping output schedules on same pin
- Validate that buffer swap occurs before its too late
- Don't handle callbacks upon scheduling, this makes recursion possible
- Replace asserts with something that doesn't use printf (remove -NDEBUG)

+ Basic tasks
    + Fan control
    + Idle Control

Perf:
- Provide metrics on decode/schedule time
- Table lookups
- memmove() somewhere?
- ccm
- bitband for buffer sets/unsets
