- Detect overlapping output schedules on same pin
- New frequency sensors that use DMA (TBD)

+ Trigger input DMA to circular buffer
+ Dwell time vs BRV
+ Basic tasks
    + Boost control
    + Fan control
    + Idle Control
    + Priming
    + Tip in Enrich

- Determine better ADC strategy, the graphs look awful for every-tooth (for now
  just gather adc async)
