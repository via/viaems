scheduling:
  priority preemption
  single-priority cooperate without time slicing
    (nth) watchdog on max execution time before yield

message queues:
  ability to overwrite

notifications: pend a task

alarms:
  - create an alarm as a timeout and pass to queue. when consumer is 
    done with task, cancel the alarm. otherwise alarm calls a callback.
    used as a watchdog for various tasks/queues

nice to haves:
  mpu isolation of individual task threads
  mpu isolation of groups of tasks data/bss
