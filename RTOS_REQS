scheduling:
  priority preemption
  single-priority cooperate without time slicing
    (nth) watchdog on max execution time before yield

message queues:
  ability to overwrite

notifications: pend a task

alarms:
  - create an alarm as a timeout and pass to queue. when consumer is 
    done with task, cancel the alarm. otherwise alarm calls a callback.
    used as a watchdog for various tasks/queues

nice to haves:
  mpu isolation of individual task threads
  mpu isolation of groups of tasks data/bss



re: mpus:
  svc is used by unpriv code
  pendsv remains a task switch
  but task switch should take action when returning to blocked threads:
    - if they're blocked on a notification, and we're waking it up, put the
      notification value into r0
    - if they're blocked on a blocking queue get, etc, perform the memcpy and
      queue ptr management
